## Machine Learning - Apache Spark - Python

### Questions to Think About
1. Can we create a way for people to find the best medication for their illness? In other words, can we use this dataset to implement a recommendation system?
2. Is this problem better suited for classification or regression? In other words, what feature (or derived feature) should be used as the outcome variable?
3. Can we determine what features or words are most important for predicting review rating or usefulness count?
